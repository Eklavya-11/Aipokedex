## History
In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, aipokedex.com was developed to address the challenge of identifying Pokemon. As a solution-oriented approach, AiPokedex was born. As time passed, its usage dwindled for me, leading to the decision to make it open source.

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
To increase the model's accuracy and performance, the data was preprocessed and augmented using several techniques. The following data preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied:

1. Cropping <br>
Randomly sampling a selection of the image and then resizing it back to the resolution of the original image, which gives a zoom effect.

2. Rotating <br>
Model learn that the object can appear in several different orientations, while also slightly changing the background of the image.

3. Mirroring <br>
Mirrioring the image vertically and horizontally, teaches the model that object may be in different orientation.

4. Quantization <br>
A compression method that reduces the number of bits available to each color channel in the image, slightly altering the color scheme of the image.

5. Gaussian Blur <br>
Blurring the image by convolving it with a Gaussian function, which gives a blur effect.

6. Gaussian Noise <br>
Adding noise to the image using a Gaussian distribution.

7. Background alternation <br>
Applying alternative backgrounds to constant pokeImg.
